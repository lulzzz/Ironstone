# CoAP resource usage profiling and anomaly detection


## TODO:
* Add Octets to computation of the profile
* Compute information about the whole dataset - num. of packets, num. of flows, num of profiles, etc.
* Compute "stability" - compare distributions for different number of samples
* Add other methods not based on probability, e.g., SVM, decision trees, ...
* Evaluate on other datasets
