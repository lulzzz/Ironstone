# Identifying a Mobile Device Using DNS Fingerprinting

 
In our research we examined the ability of DNS queries to uniquely identify mobile device. Network communication of mobile device is a valuable source of information about the device. From this communication it is possible to infer installed applications and patterns of user behavior. The goal of this study is to observe DNS communication and extract specific features from it that can be used to identify the given mobile device within unknown network data (e.g. in digital forensics).

In this case study, we show how the DNS mobile fingerprint can be created and the data mining method that can be used for the comparison of these fingerprints.
