# Coap Anomaly Detection

Smart home networks with Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be a target of cyber attacks against IoT communication since many IoT protocols are implemented without authentication or encryption. Attackers can intercept IoT communication and also manipulate with IoT devices by sending spoofed commands to IoT sensors or controllers. This case study aims to demonstrate the security issues of IoT environment and to show how anomaly behavior can be detected by application of AI methods.
